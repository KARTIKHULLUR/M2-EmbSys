#  FITNESS TRACKER


A fitness tracker is a device that uses sensors to track your orientation, movement, and rotation. The device collects data and converts it into steps, calories, heart rate monitor, temperature sensor, sleep quality and general activity you perform through the day.

## Features -

Accelerometer -  3 axis accelerometer is the most common sensor that you will find inside a wearable. This sensor can track forward and backward movement, sense gravity and determine body's orientation, position and also rate of speed change.

Step count  -  Counting of steps in recorded in the Tracker when the user starts moving.

Heart rate monitor  -    Trackers are equipped with light sensors that measure heart rate, like a photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor. The light sensors shine a light through the skin to detect blood flow and measures how many times your heart beats per minute.

Blood Pressure Monitoring  -  To calculate the blood pressure, the band uses LEDs and light sensors to determine the absorption of light by an artery.

Temperature Sensor  -  Tracker checks your skin temperature every minute. When the tracker has at least 3 nights of skin temperature data, it estimates your personal baseline temperature.



## High Level Requirements


* To operate the Accelerometer function or feature.

* To count the steps.

* calculate the heart rate of the user.

* Read the blood pressure.

* To check the temperature of the user.


## Low Level Requirements


* We need to choose the accelerometer option and start moving our body in forward or backward direction and the data gets recorded in the tracker. 

* To experience other feature in the tracker the user needs to put on the fitness tracker and should select the option which he need to perform.



## Advantages 


•	Accountability. A fitness tracker helps you exercise every day whether just walking, jogging or working out.

•	Motivation. A fitness tracker gives a visual of your progress and accomplishments each day.

•	Healthy eating.

•	Set goals.

•	Tracks sleep.

•	Stay Connected.

•	Monitors Heart Rate.

•   Alarm


## Limitation 

1) Expensive

2) Fitness trackers can be expensive to buy. If you don’t use it, you could have spent your money on something more useful.

3) Battery

4) Most trackers have limited battery life. When charging your device, you will not be able to keep track of your steps or workouts.

5) Accuracy

6) Some trackers do not provide 100% accurate metrics/information that may be shown on the device. Some of that information is just an estimate. Try not to fully rely on these devices.
