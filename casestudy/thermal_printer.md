## Block Diagram  Thermal Printer

Thermal printer is often referred as receipt printer. It is widely used in restaurants, ATM, shops and many other places where receipts or bill is required. It is a cost-effective solution and very handy to use from the user’s side as well as from the developer’s side. A thermal printer uses a special printing process which uses thermochromic paper or thermal paper for printing. The printer head is heated at a certain temperature that when the thermal paper passes from the print head, the paper coating turns black in the areas where the printer head is heated.

# Components of Basic Thermal Printer-

1) Power Supply
2) Microcontroller
3) Printing Head
4) paper Sensor Circuit
5) Motor Driver
6) Stepper Motor
7) Temperature Sensor Circuit


1) Power Supply: A power supply is an electrical device that supplies electric power to an electrical load. The main purpose of a power supply is to convert electric current from a source to the correct voltage, current, and frequency to power the load. As a result, power supplies are sometimes referred to as electric power converters.

2) Microcontroller: Microcontrollers are used in automatically controlling of printing head , paper sensor circuit ,motor driver , temperature sensor circuit along with the power supply module.It is the master head if the printer which have the control over all the sensors,commands etc.

3)Printing Head: The printhead is a component in a printer that performs the operation of burning of a dye, eventually which prints the impression on the paper. It's typically located under the cover of your printer, and it can become clogged with ink over time. 

4)Paper Sensor Circuit: It is the sensor which sense the paper availability in the printer for the printing operation.

5)Motor Driver: It is the driver which controls the speed of the stepper motor which is neccessary for the printing operation.

6)Stepper Motor: It is the main motor which performs  the process of the priting.

7)Temperatue Sensor Circuit: It sense the temperature while burning of the dye and sends the signal to the microcontroller.
