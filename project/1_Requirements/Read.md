## Introduction


- The main purpose of this  project is to develop a system for controlling common home electrical devices using wireless to enable direct control.

- Taking our first module into consideration our first requirement was to establish a control which can be both automatic and manual. The automatic control relies on contolling of relay using RF signal.

- Second is curtain control which is also working in two modes namely automatic and manual .In automatic mode curtains gets lifted up as soon as sun rises with the help of a LDR. In manual mode a complete control is given to user for lifting curtain up and down.

- Fan controlling is  provided as our third module  which requires a relay.

- Security of outer portion is also provided by a motion detecting sensor to alert the owner in case of intrusion.




## Objective

- Our Agenda is to obtain Lighting control of the house, curtain control, Fan control, gate contol and security control of outer portion of house.
